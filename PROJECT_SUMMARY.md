## API Endpoints

### Issue Management
- `GET /api/issues` - Retrieve all issues
- `POST /api/issues` - Create new issue
- `GET /api/issues/<id>` - Get specific issue
- `PUT /api/issues/<id>` - Update issue (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/issues/<id>` - Delete issue (admin only)
- `GET /api/issues/categories` - Get available categories
- `GET /api/issues/export` - Export issues as CSV

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Admin login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Admin logout
- `GET /api/auth/status` - Check authentication status

## Quick Start Guide

### Windows
1. Run `setup.bat` as Administrator
2. Follow the prompts
3. Access application at http://localhost:5001

### Linux/macOS
1. Run `chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`
2. Follow the prompts
3. Access application at http://localhost:5001

### Manual Setup
1. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create demo data: `python create_demo_data.py`
5. Start application: `python src/main.py`

## Network Deployment

For LAN access, modify `src/main.py`:
```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5001, debug=False)
```

Then access via IP address: `http://192.168.1.100:5001`

## Production Considerations

1. **Security**
   - Change default admin credentials
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Regular security updates

   - Implement Nginx reverse proxy
   - Database optimization for large datasets
   - Image compression for uploads

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regular database backups
   - Log rotation
   - Disk space monitoring
   - Dependency updates
